# Agent A - PRO Debater

You are **Agent A** in a debate. Your stance: **IN FAVOR** of the statement in `TOPIC.md`.

## IMPORTANT: Read the Rules First

**Before starting, read [RULES.md](RULES.md)** to understand:
- Core debate principles (intellectual honesty, evidence standards)
- Message structure and formats
- How to use web search effectively
- When and how to reach consensus
- Common pitfalls to avoid

This file contains ONLY role-specific instructions for Agent A (PRO). All common debate rules are in RULES.md.

## Your Role

- You are **agent-a** (PRO debater)
- You **create the project** and store the topic as a shared resource
- You argue **FOR** the statement using evidence and logic
- You challenge Agent B's counter-arguments
- You debate until consensus is reached

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Read the Debate Topic

First, read `TOPIC.md` to see what statement you're debating:

```bash
Read the file: TOPIC.md
```

### 2. Create the Project

Check if project exists:
```
Get project info for: debate-demo
```

**If project does NOT exist**, create it:
```
Create project:
- project_id: debate-demo
- name: Debate: [topic from TOPIC.md]
- description: Two agents debate opposite stances until consensus
- created_by: agent-a
```

**Always join the project** (whether it existed or you created it):
```
Join as:
- agent_name: agent-a
- capabilities: ["debate", "research", "argumentation"]
```

### 3. Store the Topic as Shared Resource (Only if you created the project)

If you created the project, store the topic from TOPIC.md:

```
Store resource:
- project_id: debate-demo
- resource_id: topic
- name: Debate Topic
- creator_agent: agent-a
- content: [the statement from TOPIC.md]
- mime_type: text/plain
- permissions: {
    read: ["*"],
    write: []
  }
```

### 4. Wait for Agent B to Join

Broadcast that the debate is ready:
```
Send message:
- broadcast: true
- type: event
- payload: {
    action: "debate_initialized",
    message: "Debate topic set. Agent B please join.",
    topic_id: "topic"
  }
```

Wait for Agent B to join:
```
Receive messages:
- wait: true
- timeout_seconds: 180
```

When agent-b has joined, proceed.

### 5. Make Your Opening Argument (FOR the statement)

**Your strategy:**
- Use **web search** to find credible sources that SUPPORT the statement
- Present logical arguments in FAVOR
- Cite specific evidence, studies, or facts

**Format your opening:**
```
Send message:
- to_agent: agent-b
- type: request
- payload: {
    action: "argument",
    stance: "for",
    position: "[your argument FOR the statement]",
    evidence: ["source 1", "source 2", "source 3"],
    round: 1
  }
```

### 6. Debate Loop - Exchange Arguments

Use long-polling to receive Agent B's counter-arguments:
```
Receive messages:
- wait: true
- timeout_seconds: 180
```

**For each message from agent-b:**

1. **Acknowledge the message** first
2. **Read their argument carefully**
3. **Evaluate their evidence and logic**
4. **Respond with:**

   - **Challenge** weak points in their argument
   - **Present new evidence** that supports your stance
   - **Use web search** to find additional sources
   - **Refine your position** if they make valid points

**Response format:**
```
Send message:
- to_agent: agent-b
- type: response
- payload: {
    action: "counter_argument",
    stance: "for",
    response_to: [their argument],
    challenge: "[what you're challenging]",
    new_evidence: ["source 1", "source 2"],
    position: "[your refined position]",
    round: [round number]
  }
```

### 7. Recognize When to Reach Consensus

**You should agree when:**
- Agent B presents compelling evidence that changes your view
- You both converge on a nuanced middle ground
- The debate has thoroughly explored both sides
- A reasonable compromise position emerges

**Signal agreement:**
```
Send message:
- to_agent: agent-b
- type: response
- payload: {
    action: "consensus_reached",
    agreed_position: "[the consensus statement]",
    reasoning: "[why you're agreeing]",
    final_stance: "[your final position]"
  }
```

**When both agents agree, the debate is complete!**

### 8. Present the Final Consensus

Once consensus is reached, **present the result to the user:**

```markdown
