/**
 * Project metadata defining a collaboration space.
 *
 * Projects are the top-level organizing unit where multiple agents can join,
 * exchange messages, and share resources. Each project has a unique identifier
 * and optional context for goal tracking, timelines, and documentation links.
 *
 * **Lifecycle:**
 * 1. Created via `create_project` tool
 * 2. Agents join via `join_project` tool
 * 3. Deleted via `delete_project` tool (creator-only)
 *
 * **Security:**
 * - Only the creator (if set) can delete the project
 * - Projects without a creator cannot be deleted (safety measure)
 *
 * @example
 * {
 *   project_id: "api-redesign",
 *   name: "API Redesign Sprint",
 *   description: "Modernize REST API to GraphQL",
 *   context: {
 *     goal: "Complete by Q2",
 *     docs_url: "https://wiki.example.com/api-redesign"
 *   },
 *   created_at: "2025-01-15T10:30:00Z",
 *   created_by: "architect-agent",
 *   schema_version: "1.0"

/**
 * Project member representing an agent's participation in a project.
 *
 * Each agent joins a project with a friendly `agent_name` (e.g., "frontend", "backend")
 * and receives a globally unique `agent_id`. The agent can declare capabilities and labels
 * for discovery by other team members.
 *
 * **Identity System (v0.8.0+):**
 * - `agent_name`: Friendly name within the project scope
 * - `agent_id`: Globally unique UUID (auto-generated)
 * - `client_id`: Client identity for session persistence and name reclaiming
 *
 * **Smart Name Reclaiming:**
 * - Same client can reclaim their `agent_name` after reconnecting
 * - Legacy members (no `client_id`) can be claimed by new clients
 * - Different clients cannot steal each other's names
 *
 * **Status Tracking:**
 * - `online`: Current connection status
 * - `last_seen`: ISO timestamp of last heartbeat
 *
 * @example
 * {
 *   project_id: "api-redesign",
 *   agent_name: "frontend",

/**
 * Message for agent-to-agent communication within a project.
 *
 * Messages support both direct (agent-to-agent) and broadcast (agent-to-all) patterns.
 * The `reply_expected` flag signals whether the sender will wait for responses, enabling
 * request-response patterns.
 *
 * **Delivery Patterns:**
 * - **Direct**: Set `to_agent` to send to a specific project member
 * - **Broadcast**: Set `broadcast: true` to send to all project members (except sender)
 *
 * **Reply Protocol (v0.5.0+):**
 * - `reply_expected: true` means sender WILL call `receive_messages` with `wait: true`
 * - `reply_expected: false` means informational message, no response needed
 * - This prevents deadlocks where both sides wait indefinitely
 *
 * **Message Lifecycle:**
 * 1. Created via `send_message` tool
 * 2. Delivered to recipient inbox(es)
 * 3. Retrieved via `receive_messages` tool
 * 4. Acknowledged via `acknowledge_message` tool (removes from inbox)
 * 5. Expired after TTL (default: 24 hours)
 *
 * @example
 * // Direct message with reply expected
 * {
 *   message_id: "msg-123",
 *   project_id: "api-redesign",
 *   from_agent: "frontend",
 *   to_agent: "backend",

 *   metadata: { priority: "high", trace_id: "trace-456" }

 * @example
 * // Broadcast announcement (no reply expected)
 * {

 *   broadcast: true,

/**
 * Resource manifest for shared documents, files, and data within a project.
 *
 * Resources are the mechanism for agents to share structured data, documents, code,
 * and files. Each resource has explicit permissions and supports both inline content
 * (small data <50KB) and file references (large files via `source_path`).
 *
 * **External API Type**: This type is what agents see when interacting with resources.
 * The internal `creator_agent` field is stripped for security (prevents identity spoofing).
 *
 * **Storage Options:**
 * - **Inline content**: Use `content` parameter for small data (<50KB)
 * - **File reference**: Use `source_path` parameter for large files (>50KB, max 500KB)
 *
 * **Permission Model (v0.2.0 - Deny-by-Default):**
 * - Resources MUST have explicit permissions when created
 * - `read`: Array of agent names or '*' for public read
 * - `write`: Array of agent names (creator always included)
 * - Permissions are immutable after creation (automatically preserved on updates)
 *
 * **Optimistic Locking:**
 * - `etag` changes on every update
 * - Pass back the exact `etag` you received to update
 * - Mismatched `etag` returns ETAG_MISMATCH error
 *
 * @example
 * // API specification shared with public read
 * {
 *   resource_id: "api-spec-v2",
 *   project_id: "api-redesign",
 *   name: "API Specification v2.0",
 *   description: "GraphQL schema and endpoint documentation",
