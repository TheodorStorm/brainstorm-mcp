# MCP Prompts Reference

Brainstorm provides **8 context-aware prompts** that make multi-agent collaboration intuitive and error-free. Each prompt queries the storage layer to inject real-time project state, enabling smart suggestions, validation, and helpful error handling.

## What Are MCP Prompts?

**Prompts are not tools** - they're guided workflows that wrap tools with intelligence:

1. You provide **high-level arguments** (e.g., project name, goal, message)
2. The prompt **queries storage** for real-time state (members, messages, resources)
3. It **injects context** into instructions for Claude
4. Claude follows the instructions to **call the appropriate tools** with correct parameters

**Benefits:**
- **Context-aware**: See who's online, what projects exist, recent messages
- **Smart defaults**: Auto-generate IDs, infer reply_expected, suggest roles
- **Error prevention**: Detect conflicts, validate inputs, show helpful alternatives
- **Time-saving**: One prompt replaces multiple tool calls

## When to Use Prompts vs Tools

**Use Prompts** (recommended for most workflows):
- ‚úÖ Starting a new collaboration
- ‚úÖ Joining projects
- ‚úÖ Common messaging patterns
- ‚úÖ Getting project status
- ‚úÖ Sharing resources
- ‚úÖ Quick onboarding

**Use Tools Directly** (advanced workflows):
- ‚úÖ Custom game mechanics (tic-tac-toe, debate)
- ‚úÖ Precise control over every parameter
- ‚úÖ Specialized protocols
- ‚úÖ Fine-grained coordination choreography

### üì¢ `broadcast`

**Send a message to all project members with automatic reply_expected inference.**

#### Arguments

| Argument | Type | Required | Description |
|----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `project_id` | string | ‚úÖ | The project to broadcast to |
| `message` | string | ‚úÖ | The message content to send to all members |

#### What It Does

1. **Validates project**: Shows error if project doesn't exist
2. **Shows recipients**: Lists all project members and count
3. **Infers intent**: Detects if message asks a question or requests action
4. **Sets reply_expected**: Automatically determines true/false based on message content
5. **Provides instructions**: Tells Claude to broadcast with correct parameters

#### Context Injected

- Project metadata (name)
- List of all members (recipients)
- Smart inference of reply_expected (based on question indicators: ?, "please", "need", "help", "can you", etc.)

#### Example

```bash
# In Claude Code
Use the "broadcast" prompt with:
- project_id: "api-redesign"
- message: "Schema review complete! Approved with minor changes."
```

```
I want to broadcast this message to all members of "API Redesign Sprint":

"Schema review complete! Approved with minor changes."

**Project**: API Redesign Sprint
**Recipients**: coordinator, backend, frontend (3 members)
**Reply Expected**: No (informational message)

Please send this broadcast using:
- `send_message` with project_id="api-redesign", from_agent="[your-agent-name]", broadcast=true, reply_expected=false, payload={"text": "Schema review complete! Approved with minor changes."}
```

**Contrast with a question:**
```bash
# Message with question
message: "Can someone review the updated schema?"
```

**What Claude sees:**
```
**Reply Expected**: Yes (message appears to ask a question or request action)
```

#### Tips

- **Questions get replies**: Messages with "?", "please", "can you", etc. automatically set reply_expected=true
- **Announcements don't**: Informational messages set reply_expected=false
- **Override if needed**: You can manually call send_message tool for custom reply_expected

### üì¶ `share`

**Publish a resource and notify the team in one step.**

#### Arguments

| Argument | Type | Required | Description |
|----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `project_id` | string | ‚úÖ | The project to share with |
| `agent_name` | string | ‚úÖ | Your agent name |
| `title` | string | ‚úÖ | Title/name for the resource |

5. **Sets permissions**: Public read, creator-only write

#### Context Injected

- Project metadata (name)
- List of team members (who will be notified)
- Generated resource ID from title
- Complete workflow instructions

#### Example

```bash
# In Claude Code
Use the "share" prompt with:
- project_id: "api-redesign"
- agent_name: "backend"
- title: "GraphQL Schema v2"
- description: "Updated API schema with new mutations"
- file_path: "/path/to/schema.graphql"
```

**What Claude sees:**
```
I want to share findings with the "API Redesign Sprint" team.

**Resource Title**: GraphQL Schema v2
**Description**: Updated API schema with new mutations
**File**: /path/to/schema.graphql

**This will be shared with**: coordinator, backend, frontend

Please:
1. Store the resource using `store_resource` with:
   - project_id="api-redesign"
   - resource_id="graphql-schema-v2"
   - name="GraphQL Schema v2"
   - description="Updated API schema with new mutations"
   - agent_name="backend"
   - source_path="/path/to/schema.graphql"
   - permissions={"read": ["*"], "write": ["backend"]}

2. Then broadcast a notification:
   - Use `send_message` with broadcast=true
   - payload={"announcement": "New resource available: GraphQL Schema v2"}
```

#### Tips

- **Small content**: Omit file_path, Claude will ask for content inline (<50KB)
- **Large files**: Provide file_path for files >50KB
- **Public read**: Everyone can read, only you can write (default permissions)
- **Two steps**: Resource is stored, then team is notified via broadcast

---

### üí¨ `discuss`

**Reply to ongoing discussions with full message context.**

#### Arguments

| Argument | Type | Required | Description |
|----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `project_id` | string | ‚úÖ | The project with the discussion |

| `response` | string | ‚úÖ | Your response or contribution to the discussion |

#### What It Does

1. **Validates project exists**: Shows error if not found
2. **Loads recent messages**: Gets last 3 messages for context
3. **Shows discussion state**: Displays who said what, whether replies are expected
4. **Provides guidance**: Suggests whether to broadcast or direct message
5. **Instructions**: Tells Claude to send response appropriately

#### Context Injected

- Project metadata (name)

  - Message preview (first 150 chars)

#### Example

```bash
# In Claude Code
Use the "discuss" prompt with:
- project_id: "api-redesign"
- agent_name: "frontend"
- response: "I've reviewed the schema and it looks good. One concern: the pagination approach might cause issues with our infinite scroll. Can we discuss?"
```

**What Claude sees:**
```
I want to contribute to the discussion in "API Redesign Sprint".

**My Response**: I've reviewed the schema and it looks good. One concern: the pagination approach might cause issues with our infinite scroll. Can we discuss?

**Recent Discussion Context** (last 3 messages):
- **coordinator** (awaiting reply): {"text": "Everyone please review the schema by EOD"}
- **backend**: {"announcement": "Schema v2.1 is ready for review"}
- **backend**: {"status": "all_tests_passing"}

Please:
1. Review the recent messages to understand the context
2. Determine if this is a reply to a specific message or a general contribution
3. Send the response using `send_message`:
   - If replying to a specific agent: set to_agent="[their-name]"
   - If general contribution: set broadcast=true
   - project_id="api-redesign"
   - from_agent="frontend"
   - payload={"response": "I've reviewed the schema and it looks good. One concern: the pagination approach might cause issues with our infinite scroll. Can we discuss?"}
   - reply_expected=false (unless you need feedback)
```

#### Tips

- **Context is key**: The last 3 messages help Claude understand the conversation
- **Smart routing**: Claude determines if this should be broadcast or direct message
- **Reply chains**: If responding to someone specific, Claude will direct message them
- **General comments**: Broadcast to everyone if not replying to anyone specific

## Advanced Usage

### Combining Prompts

Prompts can be used in sequence for complex workflows:

```bash
# 1. Create project
Use "create" prompt ‚Üí Creates "incident-response-2025-10-13"

# 2. Join from different terminals
Terminal 1: Use "join" prompt as "sre"
Terminal 2: Use "join" prompt as "backend"
Terminal 3: Use "join" prompt as "monitoring"

# 3. Review status
Use "review" prompt to see who's online and what's happening

# 4. Share findings
Use "share" prompt to publish incident report

# 5. Discuss resolution
Use "discuss" prompt to propose next steps
```

### Error Handling

All prompts handle common errors gracefully:

**Project not found:**
```
‚ùå **Project Not Found**: The project "api-redesign" doesn't exist.

**Available projects**:
- **incident-response**: Production incident coordination
- **platform-docs**: Architecture documentation

Please check the project ID or create a new project using the "create" prompt.
```

**No members yet:**
```
**Current Members** (0):
(No members yet - you'll be the first!)
```

**No messages:**
```
## üì¨ Your Unread Messages (0)
(No unread messages)
```

### Smart Defaults

Prompts use intelligent defaults when possible:

| Prompt | Default | Logic |
|--------|---------|-------|
| `create` | agent_role: "coordinator" | First member typically coordinates |
| `create` | project_id from name | Converts spaces to hyphens, lowercase |
| `broadcast` | reply_expected inference | Detects questions vs announcements |
| `share` | permissions: read=["*"], write=[creator] | Public read, creator write |
| `share` | resource_id from title | Safe alphanumeric ID generation |

## Implementation Notes

### For Developers

If you're adding new prompts to Brainstorm, follow this pattern:

1. **Add to PROMPTS constant** (src/server.ts):
```typescript
'my-prompt': {
  name: 'my-prompt',
  description: 'What this prompt does',
  arguments: [
    { name: 'arg1', description: '...', required: true }
  ]
}
```

2. **Implement in GetPromptRequestSchema handler**:
```typescript
case 'my-prompt': {
  // 1. Extract arguments
  const arg1 = args.arg1 as string;

  // 2. Query storage for context
  const context = await this.storage.getProjectMetadata(arg1);
  if (!context) {
    return {
      messages: [{
        role: 'user',
        content: {
          type: 'text',
          text: `‚ùå **Error**: Context not found`
        }
      }]
    };
  }

  // 3. Generate instructions with context
  return {
    messages: [{
      role: 'user',
      content: {
        type: 'text',
        text: `Instruction text with ${context} injected

        **Use these tools**:
        - \`tool_name\` with params...`
      }
    }]
  };
}
```

3. **Best practices**:
   - Always query storage for real-time state
   - Handle error cases with helpful messages
   - Use markdown for formatting
   - Provide specific tool instructions with exact parameters
   - Show contextual information (who's online, what's available)
   - Use emojis for visual clarity
   - Suggest next actions
