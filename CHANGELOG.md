## [0.12.2] - 2025-10-15

### Added
- **Reply Warning System** - Agents warned when messages don't expect replies
  - `receive_messages` now includes `reply_warnings` array in response
  - Warnings triggered for messages with `reply_expected: false`
  - Each warning includes:
    - Message ID and sender for reference
    - Clear alert that no reply is expected
    - Explanation that replies may not be received/processed
    - Guidance to consult human supervisor if reply seems necessary
  - Helps prevent inappropriate responses to informational messages
  - Reinforces human-in-the-loop decision making for edge cases
  - Non-breaking additive change (warnings are optional response field)
- Updated `receive_messages` tool description to document reply warning behavior

### Technical Details
- Warning detection in both long-polling and standard message fetch paths
- Follows existing `handoffAlerts` pattern for consistency
- Uses explicit `=== false` check to avoid false positives from undefined/null
- No performance impact (warnings built during message iteration)

### Rationale
Agents sometimes attempt to reply to informational messages that don't expect responses, leading to orphaned message workflows. This feature provides clear guidance at the point of message receipt, encouraging agents to verify with their human supervisor before sending potentially unnecessary replies.

### Fixed
- **Demo Scripts** - Fixed critical bug where multiple demo agents running from the same directory would get identical client_ids, causing inbox collisions and name conflicts
  - All 12 demo shell scripts now export unique `BRAINSTORM_CLIENT_ID` before launching Claude Code
  - Fixed scripts: tic-tac-toe (player-o, player-x), debate (agent-a, agent-b), pathfinding (setup, start-ant, start-manager), research-consensus (researcher-1, researcher-2, researcher-3), file-storage (storage-manager, reader-agent)
  - Ensures each demo agent gets a unique session identity even when running from shared directory
  - Prevents the session persistence mechanism (SHA-256 directory hash) from causing collisions

## [0.12.1] - 2025-10-15

### Fixed
- **Defensive locking for inbox reads** - Added file-based locking to `getAgentInbox()`
  - Prevents potential concurrent access issues when reading and auto-archiving messages
  - Serializes concurrent reads to same agent's inbox
  - 5-second timeout for lock acquisition
  - While agents properly re-poll after timeout (ensuring no message loss), lock provides defensive protection against edge cases

### Changed
- Test suite cleanup: Removed stale compiled test files from pre-v0.12.0

## [0.12.0] - 2025-10-15

### Breaking Changes
- **Removed `acknowledge_message` tool** - Messages are now automatically archived after being read
  - `receive_messages` now auto-archives messages after returning them to the caller
  - Messages moved to `projects/<project-id>/messages/<agent-name>/archive/` directory
  - No explicit acknowledgment required - reading a message marks it as processed
  - Tool count reduced from 15 to 14 tools
  - **Migration**: Remove all `acknowledge_message` calls from agent code. Messages are handled automatically.

### Changed
- **Auto-Archive on Read** - Simplified message lifecycle
  - Messages automatically moved to archive/ subdirectory after successful read
  - Consistent with existing `leaveProject()` archiving behavior
  - Provides audit trail without requiring explicit acknowledgment
  - Reduces token usage and API complexity
  - Archive directory automatically filtered from inbox reads
- Updated `receive_messages` tool description to clarify auto-archiving behavior
- Updated test suite: `tests/message-acknowledgment.test.ts` → `tests/message-receive.test.ts`
- All tests updated to verify auto-archive behavior instead of explicit acknowledgment

### Rationale
Message acknowledgment provided false reliability guarantees. Agents lose all context on crash/restart, making unacknowledged messages in the inbox meaningless. Auto-archiving on read simplifies the API while preserving message history for debugging.

## [0.10.0] - 2025-10-14

### Added
- **Coordinator Handover** - New `handover_coordinator` tool for role transfer
  - Atomic coordinator role transfer between project members
  - Single coordinator enforcement (ConflictError if duplicate coordinator detected)
  - Authorization: only current coordinator can initiate handover
  - Validation: target agent must already be a project member
  - Audit trail for all handovers
  - Use cases: coordinator stepping away, leadership transition, phase boundaries

  - Automatically backfills coordinator role to project creator on first project access
  - Triggered by any of these tool handlers: `status`, `get_project_info`, `join_project`, `send_message`, `receive_messages`
  - Idempotent and performant (short-circuits quickly if coordinator exists)
  - No locking required (writes are idempotent, single coordinator enforcement already exists)
  - Solves issue where pre-v0.10.0 projects had creators without coordinator role
  - Migration conditions: project has creator, creator is member, no existing role, no existing coordinator
- **Identity Awareness** - Enhanced status tool for multi-project clarity
  - `client_id` field shows session identifier in status responses
  - `agent_status_message` provides prominent agent-centric status ("YOU have X unread messages")
  - `identity_reminder` array with human-readable identity messages
  - Format: "📛 In project 'X' (project-id): YOU (agent-name) are the [role] agent"

  - Fixed critical bug where agents misinterpreted roles as describing humans instead of themselves
  - Updated `status`, `join_project`, and `handover_coordinator` responses to emphasize agent identity
  - All role messages now use "YOU (agent-name) are the [role] agent" format
- **Hard Block: Coordinator Leave Prevention** - Changed from warning to enforcement
  - Coordinators can no longer leave projects without first transferring role via `handover_coordinator`
  - Returns `COORDINATOR_HANDOVER_REQUIRED` error with available members list
  - Prevents orphaned projects without coordinators (was previously just a warning)
- **Handoff Message Authority Validation** - Role-based message type enforcement
  - Contributors can ONLY send `handoff` messages (not handoff_accepted/rejected)
  - Coordinators can ONLY send `handoff_accepted` or `handoff_rejected` messages (not handoff)

  - NEVER use current PWD, shell working directory after `cd` commands, or values from tool responses
  - Prevents session persistence issues caused by inconsistent directory values
  - Eliminates circular error reinforcement (responses echo input, so guidance must reference `<env>` directly)
  - **Shell wrapper startup prompt enhanced** with explicit working_directory guidance and role-awareness instructions
- **Role Reminders in send_message** - Consistent role-awareness across all messaging
  - `send_message` tool now includes `role_reminder` field in ALL responses (not just handoff messages)
  - Shows agent's role (coordinator/contributor), agent name, and role description
  - Reinforces expected behavior throughout workflow, not just at join/status checkpoints
  - Completes role-awareness system consistency across all tools
- **Enhanced reply_expected Timeout Guidance** - Explicit wait duration recommendations
  - `send_message` now includes `reply_expected_guidance` field when `reply_expected=true`

  - Notes maximum 3600 second timeout available via `timeout_seconds` parameter
  - Fills guidance gap where agents knew to wait but not how long to wait
  - Complements v0.8.0 reply_expected commitment guidance with specific timeout values
- **Conversation Closure Etiquette** - Reminder to confirm before leaving discussions
  - `send_message` now includes `conversation_etiquette` field in ALL responses

  - Shows all projects the agent is a member of
  - Displays unread message counts for each project
  - Returns total project count and total unread messages
  - Eliminates need to manually track project memberships

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL**: Fixed path traversal vulnerability in `assertSafePath`
  - Previous `startsWith()` check allowed sibling directories (e.g., `/home/user_evil` bypassed `/home/user` check)
  - Now uses `path.relative()` to correctly detect directory escape attempts

  - Consistent with all other tools (join_project, send_message, etc.)
  - Clearer semantics: identifies who is performing the operation
  - `creator_agent` field now set internally by storage layer
  - Agents cannot set `creator_agent` - validation error if attempted
  - `creator_agent` field is never exposed to agents (security: prevent identity spoofing)
- **BREAKING**: Resource creators can now update permissions on their resources

  - `creator_agent` field is immutable (always preserved from original)
  - Legacy resources without `creator_agent` are backfilled on first update

### Fixed
- Fixed metadata preservation on permission-only updates

  - Prevents bugs where agents send requests but don't listen for responses

### Changed
- **BREAKING**: Renamed `version` to `etag` for optimistic locking
  - ETags are now random 16-char hex strings (not sequential numbers)
  - Agents pass back exact ETag received (don't increment)
  - Clearer semantics: "pass what you received" vs "version number"
  - Automatic migration: existing resources get ETags on first read
  - Error code changed from `VERSION_CONFLICT` to `ETAG_MISMATCH`
